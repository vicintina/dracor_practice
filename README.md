# TEI Markup of Dramatic Works by Sumarokov and Merezhkovsky
This project contains examples of XML-TEI markup for 18th- and early 20th-century Russian dramatic texts by Alexander Sumarokov and Dmitry Merezhkovsky. The goal is to transform plain-text transcriptions into structured TEI XML, preserving and encoding features such as speaker names, stage directions, and act divisions.

## Description
The scripts process HTML-formatted or plain-text drama files, extract key textual elements using regular expressions, and convert them into valid TEI (Text Encoding Initiative) XML format. The output aims to be suitable for digital literary analysis, publication, or archival.
